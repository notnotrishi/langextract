A Siri that does way more than just setting a timer or writing down a reminder may still be nearly a year away. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple plans to release an overhauled version of Siri in the spring, which will be enhanced by the new App Intents feature. Gurman reported that the upgraded Siri will handle more complex tasks within apps, like commenting on an Instagram post, adding an item to your cart in a shopping app or editing a specific photo and sending it afterwards.

After a disappointing delay, Apple is playing catch-up to deliver on previous claims of an improved Siri. According to Gurman, the company is testing App Intents with its own apps, but also third-party apps, including AllTrails, Amazon, Facebook, Threads, Temu, Uber, WhatsApp and YouTube. For apps that handle more sensitive info, like banking apps, Gurman said that Apple may look into certain restrictions or completely avoid these apps for App Intents.

Apple gave us the first glimpse of this smarter Siri during WWDC 2024, where Apple Intelligence was the focus of the annual conference. However, the company delayed the release for the updated Siri in March, explaining that "it's going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features" and adding that the upgrades be rolled out "in the coming year." Apple even got sued for false advertising after releasing a TV ad featuring Bella Ramsey that showed off Siri's new capabilities that weren't available to the public following the release of the iPhone 16.
